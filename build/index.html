    <h1>Hey there!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple code I wrote up to help you with your workflow. It takes a screenshot and runs git all, then boots up your server. Hope you like it!</p>

    <p>If you want some examples of what you can do with this workflow, visit <a href="https://github.com/JasonHoffmann/Grunt-Workflow-Git-Screen">the Git Hub Page</a></p>
